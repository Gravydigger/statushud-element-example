# Status Hud Element Example 
An example mod for [_Status HUD Continued_](https://github.com/Gravydigger/statushud)
This mod doesn't do anything particularly useful (It shows you what hotbar slot you have selected), but demonstrates how to make an element of your own!

This is also a testing ground to demonstrate / test out features before being pushed to _Status HUD Continued_. 

For detailed documentation, refer to the Getting Started page.
